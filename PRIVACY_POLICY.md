*   **Processing:** All text analysis (counting words, converting currencies, formatting numbers, etc.) is performed **locally within your browser**.
*   **No Data Collection:** We do **not** transmit, store, or log the text content you select on any external server. Once the browser session ends or the popover closes, this data is discarded.

### C. Payment Information
All payments form "Pro" features are processed securely by our third-party payment processor, **Dodo Payments**.
